1. Connect to your WordPress server with your FTP client.
1. Copy the plugin folder to the wp-content/plugins folder in your WordPress directory. This installs the plugin to your WordPress site.

For information regarding management of the Mapbox Access Tokens, [please read this article](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/).

After you have created an Access Token, go to the **Treweler** menu in the admin panel, click the **Settings**, open the **General** tab and paste a token to the Access Token filed. Click the **Save Changes** button to save the settings.
